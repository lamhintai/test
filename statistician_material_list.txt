~~~ Sampling ~~~

Sampling (Wikipedia)

  This was very useful last time in answering last essay question!
  Sections: Population Definition, Sampling frame, Sampling methods, and Errors in sampling surveys

Discrete Random Variable
https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter3/3_1_2_discrete_random_var.php
  3.1.2 - 3.2.5 (skip the Negative Binomial distribution! For Hypergeometric, don't memorize. Just treat as a refresher how to do counting)

Continuous Random Variable
https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter4/4_1_0_continuous_random_vars_distributions.php
  4.1.0 - 4.2.3 (Focus on Normal if no time)

Sums of Random Variables
https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter6/6_1_2_sums_random_variables.php
  6.1.2 only

Point Estimate, Interval Estimate, Hypothesis Testing
https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter8/8_1_1_random_sampling.php
  8.1.1 - 8.4.4 (No need to read proofs, won't be asked I guess)
  This part may be better off using the STAT7003 notes in X1C, but sometimes this webpage has graphs.

Concepts of GDP and GNI
https://www.statistics.gov.hk/pub/B8XX00262012XXXXB0100.pdf
  The pages printed as page 1-9 (not pdf file page number), and 14-17 (I guess exclude RGNI).
  Concept only is enough..
  I remember a question asking something on how to measure a case similar to the examples on p.16 last year.

Introduction to the Consumer Price Index
  https://www.statistics.gov.hk/pub/B8XX0021.pdf
  Just first 3.5 pages are enough. Just very brief concept. No need to memorize numbers / ratios I believe.
